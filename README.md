## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM

### What I learned

I've learned to apply two background images at the same time using CSS.

### Continued development

I need to understand better the concept of Flexbox since it's really useful for creating layouts. Another thing is, to get better as well in Responsive Web Designing and Media Queries. I also need to get familiarized more with the BEM Methodology to my future challenges and projects.
